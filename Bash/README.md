# Bash

I know very little about bash so I'm using this repo to learn more about it. Some of these scripts are written for my current job. 

### App Impersonation 
This is a list of scripts I wrote to complete a task that allowed customer service agents impersonate an app on the respective mobile platforms. 

### sysinfo_page
Contains a script I wrote while learning Bash that creates the `sysinfo_page.html` file.
