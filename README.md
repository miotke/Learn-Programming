# Learn Programming 


Contains various projects and code files that I create to learn various languages and programming techniques.


## Current Work
* Python
	* UW Python Certificate: The certificate class I'm taking at the University of Washington


### History
This is a combination of two old repos _Learn-Programming_ and _Learning-Swift_. It felt odd to have two repos that essentially had the same purpose. 


### Commits Before Merge
For historic purposes...

* Learn-Programming: 103 commits
* Learning-Swift: 569 commits
