# Learn Programming 
Contains various projects and code files that I create to learn various languages, programming techniques, and topics. A lot of the stuff in this repo is projects I used while learning. Mostly projects in Python and Swift.


## Current Work
* Python
	* UW Python Certificate: The certificate class I'm taking at the University of Washington


## Languages
* Bash
* C
* Python
* Swift


## History
This is a combination of two old repos _Learn-Programming_ and _Learning-Swift_. It felt odd to have two repos that essentially had the same purpose. 


### Commits Before Merge
For historical purposes:

* Learn-Programming: 103 commits
* Learning-Swift: 569 commits
